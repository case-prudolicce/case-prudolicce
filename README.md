# JÃ©rÃ©mie Simard's Portfolio

Hi there! I'm JÃ©rÃ©mie Simard, also known as Case-Prudolicce, and this is my portfolio. I'm a metal music, cyber security, programming, and Linux enthusiast, and I'm passionate about using my skills to solve problems and create innovative solutions. Here are a few things you should know about me:

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with other repos!
- ðŸ¥… My current goal for 2023: Complete a few collaborative project.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love to do metal vocals and wish someday to make my own solo band project!

## My Projects

Here are a few examples of the projects I've worked on:

### IntelCache

IntelCache is a fully integrated cloud storage with module capabilities, written in Rust and using SQL and Diesel, a Rust SQL API. The project aimed to provide a scalable, self-hosted cloud storage solution for individuals and small businesses.

### hcli

hcli is a simple terminal script that wraps the HTTP API that Habitica, a productivity tool, exposes to give several commands to manage your online account with the only thing missing clan management. The problem it solved was solely aimed at Linux Terminal geeks, allowing them to access Habitica without opening a browser for it.

### FileFilter

FileFilter is a tool that takes Folder A with many files, Folder B with other files and creates a hashfile out of Folder B, removes matching files in the hashfile from Folder A, then sorts all files in folder A into a generated folder, based on MIME type. The problem that it solved was to alleviate data hoarders by removing any duplicate files and finding a proper place for unknown files but having them sorted.
